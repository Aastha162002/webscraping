# WEBSCRAPING

Webscraping also termed Screen Scraping, Web Data Extraction, Web Harvesting etc. It used to crawl websites and extract structured data from their pages. It can be used for a wide range of purposes, from data mining to monitoring and automated testing.

Data displayed by most websites can only be viewed using a web browser. They do not offer the functionality to save a copy of this data for personal use. The only option then is to manually copy and paste the data - a very tedious job which can take many hours or sometimes days to complete. Web Scraping is the technique of automating this process, so that instead of manually copying the data from websites, the Web Scraping software will perform the same task within a fraction of the time.

- Simple API for html extracting.
- Multi-thread and Distribution support.
- Easy to be integrated.

# Use of webscaping in real life:
- Extract product details including price, images etc. from eCommerce websites for populating other websites, competition monitoring etc.

- Extract business contact details including name, address, email, phone, website etc. from Yellow Pages, Google Maps etc. for marketing and lead generation.

- Extract property details as well as agent contact details from real estate websites.

# Method of webscraping:

## Using software

Web Scraping software falls under 2 categories. First, which can be locally installed in your computer and second, which runs in cloud - browser based. WebHarvy, OutWit Hub,
Visual Web Ripper etc. are examples of web scraping software which can be installed in your computer, whereas import.io, Mozenda etc. are examples of cloud data extraction
platforms.

## Writing code

You can hire a developer to build custom data extraction software for your specific requirement. The developer can in-turn make use of web scraping APIs which helps him/her
develop the software easily. For example apify.com lets you easily get APIs to scrape data from any website.

# Advantages of webscraping

The major advantages of web scraping services are explained in the following points.

## Inexpensive :
Web scraping services provide an essential service at a low cost. It is paramount that data is collected back from websites and analyzed so that the internet functions
regularly. Web scraping services do the job in an efficient and budget friendly manner.
## Comprehensible:
Once a web scraping services deploys the proper mechanism to extract data, you are assured that you are not only getting data from a single page but from the entire domain. This 
means that with just a onetime investment, a lot of data can be collected.
## Low maintenance and speed: 
One aspect that is often overlooked when installing new services is the maintenance cost. Long term maintenance costs can cause the project budget to spiral out of control.
Thankfully, web scraping technologies need very little to no maintenance over a long period. Another characteristic that must also be mentioned is the speed with which web 
scraping services do their job. A job that could take a person week is finished in a matter of hours.
## Accuracy :
The web scraping services are not only fast, they are accurate too. Simple errors in data extraction can cause major mistakes later on. Accurate extraction of any type of data
is thus very important.In websites that deal in pricing data, sales prices, real estate numbers or any kind of financial data, the accuracy is extremely important.

# Risk of using webscraping  

## Inscrutable :
For anybody who is not an expert, the scraping processes are confusing to understand. Although this is not a major problem, but some errors could be fixed faster if it was 
easier to understand for more software developers.
## Data interpretation : 
The data that has been extracted will first need to be treated so that they can be easily understood. In certain cases, this might take a long time and a lot of energy to 
complete.
## Time : 
It is common for new data extraction applications to take some time in the beginning as the software often has a learning curve. Sometimes web scraping services take time to 
become familiar with the core application and need to adjust to the scrapping language. This means that such services can take some days before they are up and running at full 
speed.
## Speed and protection policies :
Most web scrapping services are slower than API calls and another problem is the websites that do not allow screen scrapping. In such cases web scrapping services are rendered 
useless. Also, if the developer of the website decides to introduce some changes in the code, the scrapping service might stop workin
